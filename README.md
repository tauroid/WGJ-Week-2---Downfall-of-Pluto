## WEEKLY GAME JAM: Week 2 - Downfall of Pluto

Plutonians living in the bowels of the planet are the last to evacuate as the plutonium core becomes dangerously unstable (the surface dwellers have already left via teleporters spaced around the planet).

Gameplay

  * Plutonians are lifted up to the surface in groups, at multiple locations around the planet, at different times (increasing in frequency as the game goes on)
  * The player moves groups around the surface, trying to get them to the teleporters. The control scheme for this is undecided, but the player can only move one group at a time
  * When the group reaches a city they are no longer vulnerable (they leave Pluto in a rocket)
  * Periodically, lasers shoot from the spikes in the core, frying any plutonians caught in the beam
  * The spike glows for a small amount of time before firing, and the laser beam lasts a second or two before depleting
  * The game is infinite and score is based on the number of plutonians saved
  * You lose after a certain number of groups are lost
